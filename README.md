# winterjam
Python script I made to score free tickets for the Radio 105 Winter Jam.  

This python script works by looking for a phrase which Radio 105 puts up after their first round of free tickets. It alerts the user if the phrase goes away, which means tickets are available. The program ran every 15 minutes (to accomplish this I used the built in Windows Task Scheduler).
